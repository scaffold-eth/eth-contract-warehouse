See this convo for context: https://t.me/c/1551360911/1084
We are initially just going to move example branches into their own repo.  Ok with divergence.  

```
Was playing around  with idea that it would export  for each contract:
1.  typechain factory (for creating and initializing contract),
2.  contract definition in ts
3. eth-components/eth-hooks based component for an easy way to interact with it)

```
